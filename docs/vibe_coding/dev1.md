Now you are an expert in Pytorch, Machine Learning and AI inference. Assume that we are on a node with multiple GPUs, please adapt @scripts/02_embed_siglip.py  for distributed multi-gpu inference. You should well address the results aggregation(reduction). Besides, since we have very large scale text and images, directly stacking (concatenating) the embeddings may NOT be feasible @scripts/02_embed_siglip.py:59-130  , please find out proper ways to handle that.
