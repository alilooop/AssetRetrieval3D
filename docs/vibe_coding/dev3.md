In the current codebase we are building a service for the retrieval of 3D assets given a reference text or a reference image. Under @scripts/  there are the scripts for database building and the offline processing. @backend/app.py is the backend service @frontend/ is the front-end gradio demo. Now besides the front-end app, I hope you can implement a simple python client script, for quick testing the backend service. You can simply use the ground-truth items in the database as query inputs. Notice that to get the inputs, you may need to first get the asset ids from postgresql, and then query the text caption from correponding json caption, and load any reference image from @gobjaverse
